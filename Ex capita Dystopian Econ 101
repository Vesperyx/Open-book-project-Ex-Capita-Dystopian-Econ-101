as one could describe the way of will and demeanour of an individual one could find a form. an intangible soul of a concept or logic, when looking at the individual named George mises in this story's opening one could see utter contempt and most importantly a sense and a form of what can be described as weakness.

George mises has one strength he was reincarnated from another world where he would trade inside a VRMMO game called "ex capita" whilst he would also in his spare time listen to the works from online platforms where he would deconstruct the macro and micro economic systems at play, George mises however never had any social life, outs side his VRMMO Business sim game he played endlessly, he originally died by electrocution from his malfunctioning full dive headset, he actually made it onto the news and discovered the ten thousand hour limit of his headset within only a year and a half from release and most of his time off was not from sleep as he slept in the VR business sim, it was his time off from maintaining the headset (exploiting the too long activated please log out future to disable fast), and food and to roll around occasionally.

George was reborn into the world of earth in a different time where he was enrolled to the school "capitalism hill" all high schools in this world were replaced by an closed economic ecosystem were winning companies where later graded by there governance after passing a threshold of companies apprised worth in business criteria, this was to educate the individual high schoolers whilst fostering a great investment from the school's shareholders themself, there is little government outside the schools however there are a need for the exporting of governors over to other territories and micro nations around the world, the final destination for rulership certification would be for a CEO of a nation, nations are valuable in that they can be sold and traded in there shares in this alternative earth. governance positions can also be appraised based on policy quality and a policy's legacy.

as George entered the school grounds an individual was selling a pendant at a stand outside the school, this was said to be a lucky pendant form "The Year 12 Central Authority Crop" it was clear by George's assumptions that that this business paying the current ruler very well to have the rights to sell these pendants to the students and their parents, i would assume by my understanding that they were making an arbitrage as the schools internal currency is well under valued over the well-used gold currency used by the market, these events must have massive cash flow to those who can afford to attend these events with the wider market.

George was expected to have an assembly however that was not what happened the first thing was companies where attempting to hire the school students and where also attempting to sell to the other students there trinkets and education programs, a good program if attended could count towards marks over your business legacy at the school, however it usually cost more to attend in credits then was gained in education, you could chose a school and a teacher who was hired by these credits could teach you.

George circumvented this con as the only individual to do so in his year level as he had already attained his business skills from his VRMMO game he played in his prior life (Ex Capita). individuals were also selling information this was a legacy database of the entire school's economy recorded by technology obtained from the outer market, it usually cost ten times the price then trading in the native school as of conversion rates and tariffs imposed by the current ruling government this was an arbitrage as the software was open sourced and free for everyone and only a flat tariff applies essentially minimizing the entire total costs where only cents this was then patched by a later governing given a hefty tariff on software distribution making it essentially in-feasible to sell software not already attained in this closed society and creating a new demand for programmers in this isolated internet every year.

this lead to a programming bubble, George noticed the current government was selling its operations in a couple of days for the new generation of school students this school governing body likely would have taken out short positions over this bubble, in a way the software being sold and known to be open sourced was very clearly a hint that the need for software is very much a bubble like ecosystem, George definitely decided to not opt for the software download.

with the little starting credits available George decided to opt for starting a business from scratch and went to the licensing department and signed up for a business license George's business was dealing in the trade of insider information, this gave him more credibility when gathering information as being a formal and simple information brokerage business. it also allows the spread of information and advertising from other companies and most importantly is an in for speculators to inflate and deflate bubbles through word of mouth as an option, this puts him at an interesting possession where he held full strength over the year 10's information as most years stick together as there classes formed amongst themselves naturally that way weather due to the in equality of Resouces being exponentially different each year or because they have a natural comradery due to their sub schools classes.

his first act was to go to the biggest programming business in the entire school and then cheap insurances over the company an some short positionings over the specific business. in the meantime, later that day George got ready for assembly where the new governing body would be announced, and the fist bidding wars will commence for governance. nervously George decided to attend the optional assembly and sat down along with all the other year ten students, along the way he checked out the current data of the schools stocks for the large programming business and could clearly see a fluctuation on the screen not just in price but in legacy credits, this means business fundamentals internally where fluctuating rapidly this could either be a prediction of a failure or the biggening of the internet bubble bursting in this school, there is also a possibility they are selling all there productive assets for credits to then bid for the governances rights through there parent company. 

I gained this insight and headed to the year 12's personal game room, knocked heavily someone opened and it was none other than the biggest competitor's to the large programming company business CEO this meant that this was the prefect sale, however this was a planned operation for George as he had obtained a detailed account of all the top students habits in the higher year 12's class as a necessity for his information brokers running, this student in question for sale of these options and contracts was known to have been in the game room in his time before a speech.

the year twelve programming company competitor CEO was ready to risk a lot to gain the position to be the next governor of the year group and this opportunity could cause him to have a natural interest for him, if he lost it by not governing then he has lose it for his company, if he has won against his competitor then he would then make enough to hold position as governor as he sore this student he explained this position and then gave the option to buy these options over this competing company this student was amazed at George and decided to listen closer, the risk threshold was personally to great for George and so he had to sell these options, George has no way of covering his win himself,  George knew there was not enough time for this student to refuse to get a cheaper option out on his competitor so he was willing to make this quick transaction over the business the premiums also expanded in price rapidly as of the coming assembly later that day making any one in this trade lots of money as there is also an insurance bubble for the time before the assembly

George was There he hit the sale, the CEO who was working for the business exchanged 1000 credits for one hundred credit priced options, this was a ten times return within the first day for little risk, however there was a risk in that George if he did not hit the sale he would have likely lost everything all from his risk on, options trading where a great hedging strategy for someone who had everything and a business almost there in the certification ranks has made the sale, of course there where less total return due to tax however because I ran the money through my business I started minute earlier it was way lower then it would have been without that little bit or laundering to make the profit required before establishing a business due to high taxes.

George retuned to the assembly where the bidding wars where about to commence soon for the quarter, the business ready to bid highest was the corporation that held the rights towards the biggest programming business.

However before then where the student entry speeches where each new student where to put a say into how they are and to greet the other classmates.

Most speeches where normal however there was another student who happened to be female who started of attempting selling her special new to market options for her company, she had set the price of sale for her stock at one credit each with a total of one ten thousand stock ceiling for the first quarter after establishment, this would mean she would have given up her right to own her first company out right in the first quarter where business usually where all ready determined outcomes for success, she likely is betting on another class mates success of company because if you listened well you would know that she was selling the options for founded companies not co owned ones that also give great returns for legacy George wonders who she will team up with, probably a higher year's company

Her speech goes as said "welcome everyone my name is Alice, and I hope you will invest in our future as higher up students you have this opportunity to invest, now (breathes in and out) I'm selling my future for top dollar" Alice went on to sell her future in her options for all her companies she founds, to a year twelve individual, this means that under the contract the individual not organisation to hold this contract for as long as they are in the school and cannot be exchanged to other individuals as a student, meaning this contract will only last one year

Alice then went on to end her speech, It was now george's tern, as he got up he had a little anxiety as it happened to be his old anxiety from his other life remained to he decided to say a tiny speech just as Alice had done

George knew that this company she started was actually also started with another students investment as a pump and dump, this young lady seems to be a true blue scammer/fraudster, however all of that was residuals of the culture he left behind in the original earth he came from this was an interesting note on the entire difference in the two earths and was a page in the personal knowledge gathered earlier to day when he had purchased some details from a formalized investigative agent this Alice was only in year 10 as was himself

George started his speech "I am George and I'm going to also sell you information but this time it will be free, I will buy any amount of information on the coming programming bubble you have, the current changing leadership may not have the same faith in the benefits gained from the restrictive internet policies, next I will go on to say that we can see them having to sell of their productive R&D projects in order to come up with the funds to join the bid, they are hollowing out there stock right now for the bid essentially. As George I will be your economics advisor if you would like to have more information"

After the speech the crowd was in awe and individuals started to sell there stock in the programming business and there stocks in associated companies,  this would have neted so much profit to that CEO he had sold the options to, however it was all a half truths in that truth, in truth he knows that he has got no truth stated that would be able to be known as already the stock has been dumped and the business was best to be phoenixes down, and some individuals in the crowd where either stating how they are now rich or lost everything.

George was only seen as the catalyst whilst he knew that this was ploy as earlier that day the crash already started, with his insider information he knew that the interest in the stock's public opinion was little, it was only a few companies holding their stock as comprising investors each willing to get out the market at its saturation before bidding whilst eroding the positioning of their opponent in essence the trick was that there was little demand, George explained this to Alice sitting next to him, he said "imagine having two options for products to sell one thousand jewellery of diamond rings each netting a return of one hundred credits profit each, or the same amount of Jewlery of a leaf with an expected return of three hundred each in profit" Alice says "it is a no brainer clearly the leaves" George said "I will give you half marks however it is likely that only a handful of buyers will want gold leaves this means you will not sell as fast and more importantly this means that you're small amount of consumers who will be willing to profit you three hundred once they have purchased, after that you will need to lower prices"


Alice asked "do you know my strategy George? I know you probably deduced that I was playing to sell my personal future in exchange for a bet on someone else's"

George agreed "I also assume you have scouted a year 12's business to work for?"

Alice said "ah that was the part you got wrong, I have decided on working with you George, I hope you were not planning to go solo, even as a soul trader where you, all things serious I did decide on you George."

George was taken aback "me, wouldn't you be better off having the backing of the higher years who hold the governance you come across as having a greater acumen".

Alice stated "well actually I have my reasons to stay with you, and why I don't want to be the higher ups, higher ups just want to sell their business for credits to place in their final to lobby for control over governing seats to get governing credits and get an in with a certification of leadership and governorship to later become an adult in nation governance".

George said "that is a similar reason why i wanted to be solo, most the lower school and year 10's don't know the value of their labour and the higher ups also don't know the value in investment when they just want to get out of business and into leadership roles and titles over being productive."

there is a sound coming from the speakers hooked up to a microphone bidding has commenced after the speeches have been finalized, as the speeches are over does anyone have anything to say. an audience member puts there hands up for one final time the speaker agrees to hear it out "I would like to sue George for the act of deformation against the company known as o base capital" the speaker asked "with what government there is none now, you should all know there has been no government during this assembly, the rights have been sold to toe board and the board has no say in anything, you must then buy the rights back off the board or directors of the school to govern, this is how it has all ways been"

George knew this has he had done his research, and so had Alice, she had sold her own rights to her companies under a government that was inessentially blank slate, and the contract is voided with any governance change in a way both of them where well off.

George checked his pockets and realized something, he forgot to attempt to sell the more risky bankruptcy protection insurance options, they where still in his pocket, then he remembered, these tickets where not sold as there was a better ROI on holding them then by selling them for fractions of credits especially because you must pay monthy to hold these almost useless options.

a member from the board gets up and walks to an individual on the speaker and whispers something, it was the right to govern is going to be needed to be activated now that was said now and essentially all picked up by the speaker.

the board member got to the microphone and said "o base capital will be fined one billion credits and one million for each subsidiaries, for manipulating the currency. (the crowd went silent) o base has been shuffling outsider currency into our economy to act as an invesment to get the benefits of a currency that was expected to go up, no student has the right to un lawfully trade outside the currency imposed on everyone, the legacy credit system whilst not paying the tax to the board of directors, it is the boards prime function to insure that the simulation enlivenment is habitable and realistc, currency manipulation cannot be enabled as it will devlue the entire schools creditability and a certification provider"

essentially  o base capital who profited off of the programing bubble was actually just manipulating currency and this flood of currency was laundered through the programming employees George thought, this was the very best circumstance, his options over o base's bankruptcy was even more valuable then any other single commodity on the market. the value of a single option when from half a credit to a thousand each. with his two hundred credits worth becoming 400,000 credits hard cash. George quickly sold his options on the electrical market platform at once whilst the trading bots took all the money for these options not realizing that the credits where to be payed by the company holding the options trading bots, the X base capital the similar names came from an anti monopoly policy in a prior government where XO base captial was the soul business in the economy for essentially everything George now owned a fraction of the total credits as the bots auto sold productive rights to business to the highest bidder automatically

inessentially both of the largest businesses both went out at the same time in a matter of thirty seconds whilst alice was oblivios and just witnessed George mises turn on his chair

the speaker now back on stage and just said "lets start the bidding already do we have an initial bid" George put his hand up and said 200,000 knowing full well that the highest anyone could bid was 180,000 credits with full leverage Alice said "you mean 200 credits right" George smiled and corrected her with his face issentually saying that it was all over the economy is going to be reset Alice thought to herself that that is like one tenth of the total money supply or one one hundredth of the  supply of credits in the system including stock valuations and other things that can not be held as hard credits as they are devalued during a big sale, is George using rich perrents money to convert to the legacy credit system or something to get a head start, if so the money would have been enough to start an entire real government and run as a real CEO of an nation and not to mention the inflation caused by the influx of these new credits would issentully being enough for hyper inflation and the government would default back to the board again as to fix the market, this is not true as she checked the electronic divice of current data and all she could see was that there was a mass deflation of stock value in the system as of a minute ago. likely form the loss of O base capital, Alice looked to invest in X base capital to arbitrage however it was not there X base captial to be found on the stock market only an alert saying that x base capital was out of commission from the stock market as of in sufficient resources while all businesses qualify other then those with debt obligations to be fulfilled

once she was out of her trance in thought over the credit influx to George, Alice then head that govenacne was sold to George mises 

the bid manager and speaker asked of there where any higher offers and clearly there where none, one of the board members just whent to check over the account held by george mises and it had the correct funds the speaker said that this was un precidented in the schools history first that a year ten could even bid anything higher then fifteen thousand credits in the first day the bid master then said that it is sold to the individual at the year 10's seatings.

sure could this be a year 12 in the wrong seating aria, it cant be they would definitely be a familiar face, george mises. an individual appeared behind george mises and asked to have George make a celebratory speech and introduce and show the new plans for the school.

george got up and took stage and said that that he was nerves over the apparent victory in biding especially because it was from an incredibly foreseeable set of options and insurances that made him his money in the fist place, he should have not even been able to sell his insurances unless of the bots trading that hard amongst themselves selling and taking out debt over the entire X base capital.

what would George say, what will he do with his new responsibilities and powers. George finally started his speech and said "hello i am George and I'm now your leader, although you are new year 10s due to not having any business interests besides information i do plan on favoring the younger students development over the older and more well of individuals. this is my first reasonability in office. also I'm am skilled at macro and micro economics as self taught and i don't have the bias towards established policy as of this self study i shall then govern the money supply far greater then any other individual"

the crowd of year tens seemed to be extremely happy with the higher years being incredibly mad and booing George off stage. George now was planning on what building to rent out or buy and how to decorate the building, or even if the building should be just a small room. mid thought Alice approached George and congratulated him for his victory and success and stated "your future is completed and you are at the end of the road now and can relax and live from employing bearcats and figures taht will pay to add policies" when Alice said that they will pay to add policies they meant it literally. this was a heavy form of tolerated corruption in this alternative society George thought knowing that these deals went un punished prior

George said "my saga has just begun, this was part of my final plan. i think one thousand steps ahead of the the rest of everyone else in society, you, i believe that you do the same?" Alice said "no i could never my lord" George hearing this and heavily impressed said "my lord, you are ok with calling me this, are you sure, you are also going to be my second in command so a formal title is defiantly not necessary or a requirement" Alice responded "well i have my reasons to continue on with using such a title would you be ok with that" George agreed on the condition that is does not spark divisions and if it does she must stop immediately 

George said "would you like to help me pick out a government headquarters" Alice suggested the computer labs as the loss of the largest programming company had collapsed leaving the property being sold for fractional credits on the credit George however disagreed, we should enjoy ourselves and send a message to the other students around the school campus, how about the premium boarding house as a head quarters Alice said "oh you want to move in with the brats and other filthy autocrats and leaders do you" George stated "well actually I had a much larger scope I was thinking of re modeling the entire building and Turing the most premium building into a head quarters for the government" George approached the premium boarding house after the assembly, along with Alice, when they arrived after a short walk they came across an individual getting kicked out

George wondered if this was from the governance change with George at the crux of it. George knew that autocrats and bureaucratic folk along with lobbyists where all trading favors for job opportunities and living spaces. this corruption was not outed for yeas as governments usually repurchased the rights through the same company every year.

Alice asked "do you know what is going on here" George said "yes, they are getting ousted after the governance change they can no longer trade policy" Alice said "exactly, you know the marks gained by governance comes from the effect of implemented policies and there long term effects, if you destroy and edit every single policy there will be no long term effects and so no marks to the individuals who gave up everything to govern and gain governance marks" George realized just who he went on the bad side of, it was the most capable individuals of the higher years

george stated " we should hurry on and speak to the individual kicking out the other individual, they are whering a uniform other then the school this means that they are an employee and have a direct line to command in the building, I'm sure he knowns someone in charge" Alice agrees and continues chasing the individual in the uniform waving and asking to see him. 

the uniformed individual was tepid and has a stroke of normality about him, compared to Alice and George he was just an individual looking for a wage, the individual asked if they had a booking or if they wanted a tour of the sight, George said, i guess so, however i belive that i would like to purchase this establishment, this individual was on the clock during the assembly and that was a surprisingly elite privilege to have, that is interesting said George, he noted, you don't seem phased "Halbert" as George read the tag on his front, Halbert said, it is normal for companies to attempt to purchase the building rights for events and parties and for conferences. George stated, i believe you have misunderstand me very deeply. I was wanting to purchase the entire premium boarding house with a lump sum hard credit transaction, not rent and not for a social gathering that you had on mind, Alice explained, im very sorry, you should know my lord is very serios, he is. George is the richest of all students now and owned a fraction of the money supply currently and also he bankrupted your head quarters parent company within thirty minutes, Halbert said, why should i trust you now that i now know that im about to lose my job guaranteed soon. you where the cause as well. George stated and interrupted i also own the governance rights and am looking for new employees if i deem that you can make good decisions then there may be a place for you.

after that Alice was extremely frustrated, isn't that corruption George. we dont whant to bring back the old ways do we? said Alice. George said that is the thing, i never said that we where going to be the good guys or that making good decisions meant siding with us or calling security on us. George whispered to Alice. 

Halbert pulled up his phone and messaged the body guards. two individuals with a more punk like get up, came along. they stated to George, do you know we work under the authority of the current ruling governance, we are paid on there clock until after that assembly is over unless or governance body regains power and we get to detain you guys, George stated take a look at these card, George pulled his wallet showing a gold card to the thugs, it is me now, i won the election alice said, you won what? what is an election, george said never mind. 

the scenery was pristine, as the thugs witnessed they where out of a job. the town setting fet a littly brighter as they took each incremental step away, until one of the two thugs cracked and asked the other on there walk. "hay doesn't that mean that that guy is the soul reason why we are now un employable" they looked back and Alice and George where not there.

as Alice and George moved closer to the premium boarding house gate, he realised that there was an administration that they should have met at and not the building itself to purchase, in his old VR in his past life, in the game you just had to wave a hand gesture over a slice of the building to purchase but now this world ran on its own laws and physics and supply chain dependencies and so fourth. this was his first blunder as of coming to this new world, he had aced everything else up until then. Alice said that banks would be in a heap buying frenzy as of the cheap real estate there is, George corrected Alice now and said that well actually they all cant afford the land even, Alice asked, why, please explain fully. George said well, i have not set the interest currently, everyone's credit rating must have halved by now and they would be to busy paying off there debt over doing economic activity as they cannot credit other in this undefined times, banks need to set there collateral standards straight as they flex out others credit, I essentially tripled the interest rate in an hour by not defining it during this crisis, Alice said oh yes, i assume that you wanted to have a situation where panic deflated the currency whilst you held onto hard credit. Alice looked at her phone and she noticed something, the interest rate said 20% instead of the five percent from the prior administration, George said, can you see it now, Alice said, yes. you must be planning on buying the five year junk bond from the current leading bank as you lower back interest rates instantly realizing a better price as the yield changed from 5 to 20 and now back to five, or less. George responded, yes exactly, i let the first bond sails tail of the bonds exceed record highs then i let let the banks take the responsibility over current interest rates with the largest surviving bank take the name for the interest rate, this lead to a panic, alice looked at a pop up on her phone, interest data substituted for trading data temporarily to maintain stability as taken on by the share holders of capitalism hill. 

George now grabbing his phone set the interest rate to a two percentage, Alice asked, what have you done now, you just touched your phone for half an minute, it cannot be good. George said, I simply lowered interest to two percentage. Alice said, I'm not surprised. George just doubled his money again he just regained his entire purchase of the school governance within the day.

Alice said to George, you are a genius my lord. yields are inverse to price I only know this because my family comes from a long line of bond speculators. when interest lowers then essentially the shortening of yields to match interest is reflected over into the price and as price rises it matches maturity over the lower current interest this means that the longer time a maximum of 5 years for this schools biggest surviving bank now reflects the market itself as all bond become the same bond adjusted for each other bond to avoid arbitrages that can be exploited in seconds
